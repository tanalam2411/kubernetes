- Kubernetes definition file always contains four top level fields(must have):
```yaml
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:


spec:
```

- Explain the complete Pod object `kubectl explain --recursive=false pods`
```bash
$ kubectl explain --recursive=false pods
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is
     created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind	<string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

   metadata	<Object>
     Standard object's metadata. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

   spec	<Object>
     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

   status	<Object>
     Most recently observed status of the pod. This data may not be up to date.
     Populated by the system. Read-only. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

```

- Explain any field of Pod object(e.g., Pod's metadata).
  - use `--recursive=false` to get descriptions.

```bash
$ kubectl explain --recursive=true pods.metadata
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: metadata <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Standard object's metadata. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

     ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which
     includes all objects users must create.

   annotations	<map[string]string>
   clusterName	<string>
   creationTimestamp	<string>
   deletionGracePeriodSeconds	<integer>
