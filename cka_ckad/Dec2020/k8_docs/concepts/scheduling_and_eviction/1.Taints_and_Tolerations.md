- Node affinity, is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement). Taints are the opposite -- they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

- Add taint to a node
```bash
$ k get nodes
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
kind-control-plane   Ready    master   33h   v1.19.1

$ kd no kind-control-plane | grep -i tai
Taints:             <none>

$ k taint no kind-control-plane key1=value1:NoSchedule
node/kind-control-plane tainted

$ kd no kind-control-plane | grep -i tai
Taints:             key1=value1:NoSchedule
```

- Remove taint from a Node (Append -)
```bash
$ k taint nodes kind-control-plane key1=value1:NoSchedule-
node/kind-control-plane untainted

$ kd no kind | grep -i tai
Taints:             <none>
```

- To mark a Node unschedulable:
```bash

```
