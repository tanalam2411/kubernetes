##### DNS in a Kubernetes Pod Network

- What does DNS do inside a Pod Network?
  - Provides a DNS service to be used by pods within the network.
  - Configures containers to use the DNS service to perform DNS lookups.
  
  e.g.,:
    - You can access services using DNS names assigned to them.
    - You can access other pods using DNS names.
