##### What is the Kubernetes Control Plane?

- The k8s Control Plane is a set of services that control the k8s cluster.
- Control plane components "make global decisions about the cluster (e.g., scheduling) and detec and respond to cluster events (e.g., starting up a new pod when a replication controller's replicas field is unsatisfied)".
- [ref](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components)
