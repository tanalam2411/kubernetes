##### Cluster Network Architecture

- Important CIDR ranges:

- Cluster CIDR - IP range used to assign IPs to pods in the cluster. We have set it `10.200.0.0/16` in [controller manager conf](18.setting_up_the_k8s_controller_manager.md).

- Service Cluster IP Range: IP range for services in the cluster. 
  - This should not overlap with the cluster CIDR range. We have set it `10.32.0.0/24` in [controller manager conf](18.setting_up_the_k8s_controller_manager.md).
  
- Pod CIDR - IP range for pods on a specific worker node. This range should fall within the cluster CIDR but not overlap with the pod CIDR of any other worker node.
  - Here we're using [Weave](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave) networking plugin which will automatically handle IP allocation to nodes, in our case there is no need to manually set a pod CIDR.
