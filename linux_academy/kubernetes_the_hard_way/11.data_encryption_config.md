- Kubernetes Secret Encryption
  - K8s supports theability to encrypt secret data at rest.
  - This mean that secret are encrypted so that they are never stored on disc in plain test.

  - W'll generate an encryption key and put it into a configuration file.
    - then copy that file to our k8s controller servers.
