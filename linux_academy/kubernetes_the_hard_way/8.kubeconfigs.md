##### [Kubeconfigs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)

- A Kubernetes configuration file, or `kubeconfig` is a file that stores "information about clusters, users, namespaces, and the authentication mechanisms".
- It contains the configuration data needed to connect to and interact with one or more Kubernetes clusters.

- Contains information such as:
  - Location of the cluster you want to connect to
  - What user you want to authenticate as
  - Data needed in order to authenticate, such as tokens or client certificates.
  
- We can even define multiple contexts in a kubeconfig file, allowing to easily switch between multiple clusters.


- The kubelet service on our worker nodes uses kubeconfig to locate the kubernetes API and authenticate with it.
