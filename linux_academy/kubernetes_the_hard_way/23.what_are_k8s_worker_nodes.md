##### What are the Kubernetes Worker Nodes ?

- Kubernetes worker nodes are responsible for the actual work of running container applications managed by kubernetes.

- kubelet - Controls each worker node, providing the APIs that are used by control plane to manage nodes and pods, and interacts with the container runtime to manage containers.

- kube-proxy - Manages iptables rules on the node to provide virtual network access to pods.

- Container Runtime - downloads images and runs containers. e.g., Docker, Containerd
