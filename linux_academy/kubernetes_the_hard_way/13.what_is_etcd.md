##### What is etcd?

- `etcd` is a distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data across a cluster of machines.
- `etcd` provides a way to store data across a distributed cluster of machines and make sure the data is synchronized across all machines.

##### How is `etcd` used in Kubernetes?

- k8s uses etcd to store all of its internal data about cluster state.
- This data needs to be stored, but it also needs to be reliably synchronized across all controller nodes in the cluster.

- We will need to install etcd on each of out k8s controller nodes and create an etcd cluster that includes all of those controller nodes.
